# Datasets with programming languages info

![Script mining data](/assets/extracting-languages-info.gif)

The goal of this repository is mining information to create datasets about programming languages. 

**Now the dataset has more than 600 languages**, 

which include the website of the languages, creation date, your paradigms, and type systems.

Besides, I have the goal to include information about the trends of each language, so, feels free to send suggestions about how to do it, or make it and send a pull request.
